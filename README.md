# InventoryApp
Android App for keeping track of a store's book inventory

The app allows to add books, including contact data for the supplier, and keeps track of the available quantity.
The quantity can be reduced by 1 (if > 0) via the "Sale" Button next to each book.
The app also allows to add "dummy data" consisting of 2 placeholder books to test the functionality of the app.
